# Java-Selenium-Cucumber-Framework
1-Runner
The Runner is the brain of the Cucumber framework. It triggers tests and includes configurations such as plugins, features, glue, and tags under the runner class. It specifies which feature files to execute, links them to step definition files, and configures reports, hooks, and tags.

2-Features
Feature files are where test scenarios and steps are written in simple language using Gherkin syntax, making them easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand.

These files describe the application’s behavior in a human-readable format. They serve as a bridge between business stakeholders and developers/testers. Scenario Outline can be used in feature files to execute the same scenario with different datasets.

3-Step definitions
Step definition files contain the implementation of the steps written in the feature files. These files map Gherkin steps like “Given,” “When,” and “Then” to actual code. They also contain the logic for interacting with the application, such as clicking buttons or entering data.

4-Pages
In the Pages, I initialize the web elements repository and organize multiple or single web elements with different locators. This is where the Page Object Model (POM) comes into play. It improves the reusability and readability of the code and centralizes locators and methods for interacting with web elements.

5-Utilities
Utilities house reusable methods, database interactions, and API-related functionality. This section helps avoid duplication by managing tasks like reading property files, taking screenshots, and generating test data.

In addition to these features, I would highlight two other important components: Resources/Configuration Properties and POM.xml.

The Resources folder is useful for storing small and static test data, such as configuration settings, though it is not suitable for large or complex test data. For those cases, a separate file under src/test/resources is preferred.

POM.xml is the heart of the framework. It is a Maven file used to manage project dependencies and plugins. By adding plugins like Surefire, Failsafe, or Master thought, I can generate HTML reports.

In this article, I have shared the key components of a test automation framework built using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber. While multiple tools and techniques are available, the foundation of any effective framework lies in its structure and organization.

The Page Object Model (POM) plays a critical role in improving code reusability, readability, and maintainability. By integrating elements like Runner, Feature files, Step Definitions, and Utilities, along with POM, we can create a robust and scalable framework that supports efficient and reliable testing. Regardless of the tools or languages used, focusing on a well-structured approach is key to successful automation.
